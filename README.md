## How this was built

### Create the React app

```bash
npx create-react-app tachyon-camera-uploader
```

You will see:

```bash
Success! Created tachyon-camera-uploader at /home/brian/sandbox/tachyon-camera-uploader/tachyon-camera-uploader
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd tachyon-camera-uploader
  npm start
```

### Verify the app starts

Follow the advice offered and:

```bash
cd tachyon-camera-uploader
npm start
```

A browser window should open to http::/localhost:3000

### Install semantic UI

Open a new window so the node app remains running.

```bash
npm install --save semantic-ui-react
```
